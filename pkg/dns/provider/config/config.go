package config

// This package is kept for potential future use or for loading provider configs
// from external sources. Currently, all providers use OpenAPI-only approach
// and configs are generated automatically from OpenAPI specs.

// Note: The OpenAPI-only approach means we no longer load manual config.yaml files.
// All provider configurations are generated from openapi.yaml files automatically.
